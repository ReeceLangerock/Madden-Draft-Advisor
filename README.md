# Madden-Draft-Advisor

The Madden Draft Advisor is a Java application used to assist the scouting and drafting of players in Madden NFL 2017. The .jar file in the repository is a working executable for the Draft Advisor.

The program allows you to create a draft board, enter name, position, age, projected draft round along with scouting and combine information to accurately estimate what the players physical attributes will be with 1 or sometimes 2 points. You can use the draft board to sort players by any attribute, and can double-click to 'cross out' players as the draft progresses.
